# School District Analysis

## Project Overview

### Purpose

#### Initial Analysis
The purpose of this project was to assist Maria, the Chief Data Scientist for City School District, in analyzing data on student funding and student'ss standardized test scores. Specifically, my task was to aggregate the data and showcase trends in school performance. This will assist the school board and superintendent in making decisions regarding school budgets and priorities. 

#### Updated Analysis
After completing the initial analysis, the school board informed Maria and her supervisor that the stuents_complete.csv file showed evidence of academic dishonesty. The dishonest data included the math and reading scores for ninth graderes at Thomas High School. To uphold state-testing standards, Maria tasked me with replacing the dishonest scores with null values, while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once this was complete, I repeated the full school district analysis and examined how the changes affected the results overall. 

### Resources
